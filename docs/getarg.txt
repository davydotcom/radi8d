char *GetArg(int arg,char *ArgString,char Delim)
------------------------------------------------
This function is used to get a part of a delimited string. For Example
Say you had the string "abc:123:hello:world"
What if you wanted to get the 3rd argument in the string.
You would simply type this;

char *value = GetArg(2,"abc:123:hello:world",':');
now value should contain the word "hello"
If youwonder why I passed the argnum as 2 rather than 3 since I needed the 3rd arg it is because the first arg actually is 0. This function may prove very useful in gathering the data sent from a remote connection to the server.
